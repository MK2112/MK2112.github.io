              Radio waves tell lies by the time they arrive. In modern wireless communication systems like Wi-Fi,
              Bluetooth, or Starlink, the transmitted signal works against an adversary: the channel.
              Transmitting a signal over the air corrupts through scattering, interference, shadowing, noise,
              and unpredictable fading.

              The air is a favored medium for its flexibility, offering rapid scalability. A central challenge of wireless
              communication is the restoration of the true signal contents from distortion
              through the easily affectable wireless transmission channel. The restoration should happen efficiently and
              swiftly. This is precisely the task that channel estimation and equalization are concerned with.<br />
              <br />
              This post explores the inner workings of channel equalization, tracing an evolution from early
              linear filters to adaptive equalizers and the AI-driven systems of tomorrow that learn and
              adapt in real-time as signal properties constantly change beneath them.

            <h3>The Hostile Channel</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Wireless signals are confronted with several distinct phenomena degrading
              their quality and interpretability. Effects like multipath propagation, thermal and background noise,
              Doppler shifts, and nonlinear amplifications become increasingly severe as data rates and operating
              frequencies increase \cite{tse2004fundamentals} \cite{madhow2008fundamentals} \cite{hassan2022performance}. To build high-throughput
              systems capable of extracting meaning from affected signals, we therefore must first understand the
              nature of the adversaries we face.
            </p>
            <h4>Attenuation and Free-Space Path Loss</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              A wireless signal loses its strength as distance increases. In an environment with no
              obstructions whatsoever, the received signal's power $P_r$ diminishes with the square
              of the distance $d$, but also by quite important other factors, as described by the
              Friis transmission equation:
              $$ P_r = P_t \cdot G_t \cdot G_r \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2 $$
              Where:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-ul">
              <li>$P_r$, the received signal's power (in Watts)</li>
              <li>$P_t$, the power with which the signal was transmitted (in Watts)</li>
              <li>$G_t$, the transmitting antenna's gain relative to a hypothetical, spherically emitting antenna (the isotropic radiator)</li>
              <li>$G_r$, the gain of the receiving antenna relative to an isotropic radiator</li>
              <li>$\lambda$, the transmitted signal's wavelength (in meters), calculated with the speed of light $c$ and frequency $f$: $\lambda = c / f$</li>
              <li>$d$ is the distance between sender and receiver antennas (in meters)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Friis' equation illustrates that even in the simple setting of a free, unobstructed
              space, the receivable power of a signal decreases as the distance increases \cite{madhow2008fundamentals}.
              Again, this is intuitive, but the factors appearing in the equation may not be.<br />
              This attenuation, or fading, occurs because only a portion of a sphere describing the emitted energy reaches the receiver,
              and this fraction diminishes as distance grows. We have to consider quite a multitude of
              factors to express these signal emission characteristics: Sent signal power, antenna
              characteristics, the wavelength and this particular way in which we model an ideal
              spherical signal emission from the sender.

            <p class="blog-p">
              In practical contexts, a 5G signal at 28 GHz experiences much higher path loss compared to a 4G signal
              at 2 GHz over the same distance, often resulting in tens of decibels increase in loss (e.g., around 29 dB
              higher path loss for 28 GHz vs. 2 GHz given a distance of 1 km). This necessitates more sophisticated
              equalization techniques, and we have to research and apply more increasingly
              equalization techniques as they reward us with higher data rates \cite{senic2022challenges}.
              Path loss really is just one of several challenges, though.
            </p>
            <h4>Noise</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Noise can be understood as any random amount of energy added with no periodicity to a signal by the
              environment and the receiver \cite{agbo2017principles}. Remarkably, it was found that this highly unpredictable
              occurrence can often be aptly modeled and simulated by the so-called Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img">
              <!--Enlarge: 50%-->
              <img src="../img/eq_awgn_distortion.png" alt="Three stages of varying AWGN intensity" style="width: 55%" />
              <p class="blog-img-caption">Three stages of varying AWGN intensity</p>
            </div>
            <p class="blog-p">
              You can see that some AWGN can be bearable, but the stronger noise gets, the less
              distinctly interpretable the signal's characteristics, i.e., the less distinctive
              and interpretable the periodic wave-form.<br />
              The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the ratio of signal power to noise power, is a
              critical measure of signal quality and fundamentally limits the achievable data
              rate, as described by the Shannon-Hartley theorem \cite{madhow2008fundamentals}:
              $$ C = B \cdot \log_2(1 + \frac{P_{\text{Signal}}}{P_{\text{Noise}}}) $$
              Where:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-ul">
              <li>$C$: Channel capacity, the maximum transmission rate given the channel conditions. (in Bits/s)</li>
              <li>$B$: Channel bandwidth, the width of the frequency band used for communication. (in Hertz)</li>
              <li>$P_{\text{Signal}}$: Average power of the received signal. (in Watts)</li>
              <li>$P_{\text{Noise}}$: Average power of encountered noise within the bandwidth $B$. (in Watts)</li>
              <li>$P_{\text{Signal}}/P_{\text{Noise}}$: Our SNR. This expresses how much stronger a signal is compared to the noise.</li>
              <li>$\log_2$: Logarithm with base $2$, helping to express the result in binary representation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The Shannon-Hartley theorem expresses that the channel capacity can be increased either by
              using more bandwidth or by improving the SNR, meaning raising the signal's
              power or decreasing noise. However, the theorem assumes this noise to be
              AWGN, a simplification that breaks down in real-world scenarios all too
              often. AWGN is just one component in what we call noise, so looking at it
              is helpful, but we're still not done with a full description of what noise entails.

            <h4>Multipath Fading and Intersymbol Interference</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Signals transmitted over the air may reflect off buildings, scatter, diffract, and be shadowed by obstacles.
              These effects cause parts of the signal to travel different distances, resulting in the signal arriving
              smeared across time rather than at a single determinable instant \cite{akram2007pilot} \cite{tse2004fundamentals}.
              This is because reflections act like weakened copies of the signal, arriving at the receiver with different delays.
              Additionally, this multipath propagation may affect different frequencies in different ways, leading to 
              (frequency-selective) Intersymbol Interference (ISI).
            </p>

            <p class="blog-p">
              ISI is problematic. Symbols smearing into one another can change the
              value we may interpret from them. Below, we send the intended
              sequence $1011010110$, but with ISI corrupting and smearing the signals,
              we falsely read $1111111111$ at the receiver.

              <b>The task of an equalizer is to mitigate fading, noise and ISI for a signal to such an extent
                 that the equalized signal represents the sent values again.</b>
                 The ISI-affected signal in the above graph reaches higher amplitudes than the original because multiple delayed copies
                 overlap constructively. This periodically boosts the received signal's amplitude.
            </p>
            <h3>Linear Equalization</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              One approach to reversing signal distortions is to treat the
              channel as a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system \cite{tse2004fundamentals}. Under this assumption,
              when a signal $x(t)$ is sent, the received signal $y(t)$ is only ever
              scaled by a constant factor $h$:
              $$y(t) = h \cdot x(t)$$
              With five times more power, a five times stronger signal
              will be received, always affected by the constant scaling factor $h$.
              Formalized, this means:
              $$a \cdot y(t) = h \cdot a \cdot x(t)$$
              The channel may introduce a delay $d$ between the sent and the received signal.
              If we assume the channel to be an LTI system, $d$ were to always remain the same:
              $$y(t + d) = h \cdot x(t)$$
              The LTI assumption underlies linear equalization, which employs inverse
              filtering to reverse the channel's influences. We will look at two of
              the most common linear equalizers.
            </p>
            <h4>Zero-Forcing Equalization</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The Zero-Forcing (ZF) equalizer attempts to perfectly invert the
              channel's frequency response, expressed by the complex-valued function
              $H(j\omega)$. This function takes as input a frequency $\omega$ (rad/s)
              and produces as output a complex number representing the amplitude gain
              and phase shift that the channel applies to a sinusoidal input at that
              frequency \cite{jiang2011performance}. We won't look into complex values
              here, but $j\omega$
              expresses a frequency as originally being a component of a complex value
              expression, hence the $j$. The ideal ZF equalizer simply formulates the
              inverse of the channel: $$C(j\omega) = \frac{1}{H(j\omega)}$$
              A received signal $Y(j\omega)$ is ZF-equalized by multiplying it with $C(j\omega)$:
              $$\text{Signal}_{\text{ZF-equalized}} = C(j\omega) \cdot Y(j\omega) = \frac{Y(j\omega)}{H(j\omega)}$$
              A problem arises when the channel has a deep/'strong' fade (meaning
              $|H(j\omega)|$ is close to zero) at certain frequencies. The equalizer's
              response will be enormous in order to correct for those frequencies. A weak
              signal implies a low SNR, meaning that signal and noise become increasingly
              indistinguishable. Therefore, given low SNR, the ZF equalizer will massively
              amplify the signal but also the noise and by doing so potentially obliterate
              any remaining distinct signal information \cite{jiang2011performance}. Today,
              because of this, ZF is only rarely used, and more advanced equalizers found
              their way to widespread adoption.
            </p>
            <h4>Minimum Mean Square Error Equalization</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizer is utilized in modern Wi-Fi and
              LTE systems. It seeks to minimize a mean squared error between the original and
              equalized signals. The difference to Zero-Forcing is that MMSE balances inverting
              the channel and amplifying noise by explicitly considering
              the SNR \cite{kulkarni2014performance}. In low-SNR conditions or at frequencies with deep fades, MMSE tempers
              the amplification and accepts some residual ISI to avoid excessive noise
              amplification. The MMSE filter is defined as:
              $$\text{Signal}_{\text{MMSE-Equalized}} = \frac{H^*(j\omega)}{|H(j\omega)|^2 + \frac{1}{\textrm{SNR}}}$$
              Where:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-ul">
              <li>$H(j\omega)$ is the function producing the channel fequency response, we know this from ZF</li>
              <li>$H^*(j\omega)$ is the complex conjugate of this channel frequency response</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-p">
              As the SNR approaches $\infty$, the signal becomes clearer and the MMSE equalizer converges to the
              approximate behavior of a ZF equalizer. However, for finite SNR values,
              MMSE provides a crucial compromise, typically improving bit error rates by $2$ to $3$
              orders of magnitude compared to ZF in challenging multipath
              environments \cite{kulkarni2014performance}.<br />
              <br />
              To put this into context, ZF inverts the channel exactly, hence the
              $C(j\omega) = \frac{1}{H(j\omega)}$. MMSE now inverts approximately,
              specifically because of noise. Hence the above formulation for
              $F_{\text{MMSE}}(j\omega)$. The point is that the $\frac{1}{\text{SNR}}$
              term acts as a regularizer, preventing outsized amplification when the
              squared absolute channel frequency response $|H(j\omega)|^2$ is very
              small. In other words, we avoid falling into a pit of "rescuing" a small
              remainder signal from a noised channel.<br />
              <br />
              While an improvement, linear equalizers rely on the assumption of LTI realistically
              expressing how the channel works. This is an idealization, as real-world channels
              may deviate from perfect LTI behavior, especially under fading, ISI and rapidly
              changing conditions in general. Linear equalizers still struggle with severely
              distorted channels, especially those with deep frequency nulls or nonlinear
              characteristics.
            </p>
            <h3>Nonlinear Equalizers: LTI's Looming Shadow</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The LTI model for channel behavior falls short of capturing the true
              complexities and implications for signal reconstruction. To overcome
              the limitations of linear filters, nonlinear techniques emerged.<br />
              Nonlinear techniques go beyond a fixed frequency-domain inversion,
              making use of time-domain relationships and sequence behavior.
              Specifically, nonlinear equalization approaches feed prior
              decisions back into the current equalization process, explicitly
              combating effects like past symbol ISI bleeding into the current

              time-variant signal properties.

            <h4>Decision Feedback Equalization</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) realizes a hybrid structure that
              partitions the ISI problem on the time-axis. To do this, DFE applies
              two distinct filters to the signal as it is being received. A linear
              Feedforward filter (FFF) tackles the ISI caused by symbols yet to
              arrive, the so-called precursor ISI. An additional, nonlinear
              Feedback filter (FBF) uses the receiver's past symbol equalization
              decisions to estimate the ISI by which they are estimated to affect
              the current symbol, the postcursor ISI.<br />
              <br />
              In a discrete time domain, DFE can be formulated like so:
              $$\text{Signal}_\text{DFE-Equalized} = \underbrace{\sum_{l=-L_\text{FFF}}^{0} q_\text{FFF}[l] \cdot z[m-l]}_{\text{Feedforward Filter}} + \underbrace{\sum_{l=1}^{L_\text{FBF}} q_\text{FBF}[l] \cdot a[m-l]}_{\text{Feedback Filter}}$$
              Where:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-ul">
              <li>$z[m]$ denotes the input sequence to the DFE, which gets sampled from the received signal</li>
              <li>$q_\text{FFF}[l]$ are the feedforward filter coefficients, the filter settings, applied over time indices $l=-L_\text{FFF}$ to $0$ to suppress precursor ISI from $-L_\text{FFF}$ yet to arrive next symbols</li>
              <li>$q_\text{FBF}[l]$ are the feedback filter coefficients applied over $l=1$ to $L_\text{FBF}$ to reconstruct and cancel postcursor ISI from the already-detected past symbols</li>
              <li>$a[m - l]$ represents the decision output of the estimated transmitted symbols at time $m-l$, which is used by the feedback filter to estimate the ISI caused by prior, distinct and already seen symbols</li>
            </ul>

              By subtracting the dedicated pre- and postcursor ISI estimates from
              the incoming signal, DFE avoids the noise amplification problem of
              linear equalizers and explicitly addresses non-linear factors like
              postcursor ISI \cite{reuter2002mitigating}. DFE much more closely follows of a line of
              distinguishing the signal and its behavior from what the channel
              induces upon it. However, things aren't all that perfect.<br />
              DFE introduces a new vulnerability: error propagation. If the
              receiver makes a wrong decision about a symbol, that incorrect
              information corrupts the ISI estimate, affecting the feedback
              filter and increasing the likelihood of filtering subsequent
              errors. A single error can trigger a cascade of errors until
              the system recovers.<br />
              <br />
              With the example below, a DFE system is applied to a moderately noisy
              QPSK signal (SNR $= 30\ \text{dB}$) that has passed through a
              4-tap channel exhibiting strong postcursor ISI. The DFE operates
              decision-directed with only two forward and three feedback taps.
              When we inject a short burst of symbol errors, their wrong values
              get fed back into the ISI cancellation, corrupting subsequent symbol
              estimates and triggering the observed propagated error.

              Burst errors are indeed a regular occurrence in wireless channels,
              which makes being susceptible to them a particularly bad slip-up
              on DFE's end. If there is a potential for a single event to
              cascade into a chain of subsequent errors, it could
              compromise DFE's use for particularly complex channel settings.
            </p>
            <h4>Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              If DFE is a clever trick, Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation
              (MLSE) is the theoretically optimal solution for channels with ISI
              in the presence of AWGN \cite{madhow2008fundamentals}. Instead of deciding one
              after another for each symbol on equalization properties, MLSE asks
              a more holistic question: given the entire received sequence of
              distorted symbols, what is the most likely sequence of symbols that
              was originally transmitted, causing this received shape?<br />
              <br />
              MLSE finds its application for example in GSM cellular systems.<br />
              To be usable in such settings, MLSE models a channel's memory,
              and its interaction with itself across the time-axis. This is visualized
              using a trellis diagram. This will be shown in just a moment.
              With the trellis diagram as basis, the Viterbi algorithm is applied
              to the received signal sequence (some limited horizon back into
              the past) \cite{manelis2013signal}. Across this sequence, Viterbi
              allows for efficiently finding the most probable set of actually sent
              symbols, whose corresponding sequence produces a signal that most
              closely matches what was received.
            </p>

              <p class="blog-img-caption">MLSE applies the Viterbi algorithm in a trellis diagram</p>
            </div>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The above figure shows a complete MLSE decoding example. In its
              context, the trellis diagram in the middle represents all
              possible sequences of the previous $\text{L} = 2$ transmitted symbols
              as distinct states at each timestep. Each node in the diagram
              corresponds to a unique history of the last two bits, and each
              edge a possible transition caused by the new input bit. For every
              transition, the expected noiseless channel output is computed
              from the channel impulse response and the bits defining that
              transition.<br />
              The Viterbi algorithm uses this structure to efficiently find the
              path through the trellis whose sequence of outputs most closely
              matches the received, noisy signal (top graph). From this optimal
              path, the decoded bit sequence is recovered (bottom graph),
              producing a reconstructed waveform that closely
              follows the originally transmitted signal despite the
              channel distortion and noise.<br />
              <br />
              MLSE works very differently than all the other equalization
              techniques we discussed, but its complexity also is its greatest
              shortcoming. The number of states in a trellis grows exponentially
              with the channel's memory length ($L$) and the modulation order
              ($M$), as $M^L$. For a 64-QAM system with a 10-tap channel impulse
              response, this translates to $64^{10} \approx 10^{18}$ states,
              computationally overwhelming for real-time processing. On top of
              this, the Viterbi algorithm is susceptible to veering off course
              in its restoration efforts when encountering burst errors spanning
              multiple symbols \cite{wu2013twophase}. This is why MLSE is rarely
              used in high-order modulation systems, despite its theoretical optimality.

            <h3>The Adaptive Revolution: Equalizers that Learn</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Real-world communication channels are rarely static, but rather
              time-variant. Smartphones are carried around constantly, environmental
              conditions around them change, and the channel characteristics morph and shift along
              with that. An equalizer with fixed coefficients is insufficient for such highly dynamic systems.
              An equalizer must adapt to changing conditions in the channel, quickly, cheaply and reliably so.<br />
              <br />
              Adaptive equalizers continuously adjust their filter coefficients.
              This is typically achieved in two phases: A training
              phase utilizes some known sequence that is sent specifically to
              allow for initial convergence on the receiver's filter settings.
              The follow-up, the tracking phase, then has the equalizer adapt
              based on its own decisions and changes in transmission while live
              data is coming in \cite{hassan2022performance}.
            </p>
            <h4>Least Mean Squares</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm is often applied due to
              its simplicity and low computational cost ($O(N)$ per symbol, $N$
              being the number of filter taps). One can think of LMS as a form
              of stochastic gradient descent. It can be found in virtually every
              modern communication system from Bluetooth to satellite modems.<br />
              <br />
              For each symbol, LMS calculates the error $e[n]$ between its output
              and the desired signal and then adjusts its filter weights ($w$) in
              the direction that minimizes this perceived error \cite{jalali2012wireless}.
              In this sense, the core of this algorithm is its weight update rule:
              $$ w[n+1] = w[n] + \mu \cdot e^*[n] \cdot x[n] $$
              One can think of $\mu$ as the step-size parameter. It expresses a
              pretty important trade-off: a larger $\mu$ leads to faster
              convergence but more residual error ("misadjustment") in the
              steady state. This effect is called "overshooting."
              Consequently, a smaller $\mu$ has LMS converge slower but more
              precisely so. The vector $x[n]$ contains the current and recent
              input samples, meaning the raw data being fed into the adaptive
              filter. The term $e[n]$ is calculated by $d[n] - y[n]$, expressing
              the difference between the desired output $d[n]$ and the filter's
              actual output $y[n]$. Note that LMS actually uses its complex
              conjugate $e^*[n]$ in the update to ensure that the update follows
              the gradient of the squared error function when working with
              complex-valued signals and weights. All of this feeds into
              the update of the weight vector $w[n]$, representing the former
              filter configuration.

            </div>
            <p class="blog-p">
              LMS takes a step in the direction that reduces the error only for
              one respective current symbol at a time. In practical
              implementations like Wi-Fi, LMS converges better than any of the
              above non-adaptive equalization schemes, typically reaching a local optimum
              within 20-40 microseconds for 802.11ac systems \cite{wyglinski2018sdr}.
              This makes LMS a widely adopted equalization scheme today.
            </p>
            <h4>Recursive Least Squares</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              While LMS specifically considers the error of the current symbol,
              the RLS algorithm takes a more global, historically-informed view.
              This makes it a preferred choice for rapidly changing, strongly
              affected channels. RLS seeks to find the set of filter coefficients
              that would have minimized the total weighted squared error over
              all past symbols, not just the current one \cite{jalali2012wireless}.
              It does this by recursively updating the filter coefficients, giving
              more weight to recent errors via a "forgetting factor" $\lambda$,
              which is typically a little lower than $1$. The cost function $\lambda$
              minimizes is:
              $$ C(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n \lambda^{n-i} e[i]^2 $$
              Considering the ever-accumulating history for tuning the current
              filter settings yields a broader view of signal characteristics
              and thus more broadly educated filter updates \cite{vijay2014performance}. This grants RLS
              higher convergence speeds compared to LMS, which is a
              crucial advantage in scenarios where channel coherence times can be
              short (e.g., Car2X, military applications).

              However, the added performance comes at the cost of a computational
              complexity of $O(N^2)$ and a greater risk of numerical instability
              from constantly adding values over time. Commercial RLS
              implementations typically require 32-bit floating-point arithmetic
              versus 16-bit fixed-point for LMS, increasing both power consumption
              and silicon area.
            </p>
            <h3>The AI Frontier</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Traditionally, channel equalizers used mathematical models (like ZF and
              MMSE) or update rules (LMS and RLS) to tune filters based on signal
              differences. Current research however is moving away from the traditional,
              model-driven concepts toward data-driven AI methods.

              Neural networks like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term
              Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Transformers allow for
              modeling complex, non-linear signal behavior and interdependencies
              \cite{hassan2022performance} \cite{zhu2025liquid}.
              Reinforcement Learning optimizes strategies through interaction (e.g.,
              antenna positioning), boosting throughput in vehicular links.
              As a newly emerging architectural approach, Liquid Neural Networks
              offer real-time adaptation with low energy consumption \cite{zhu2025liquid}.<br />
              <br />
              But there really is no free lunch. AI equalizers demand more
              compute, require extensive, broadly representative training data,
              and lack the interpretability of linear methods. Specialized hardware
              and emerging standards are addressing these issues.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Channel equalization has evolved from simple linear inversion techniques
              to sophisticated AI-driven adaptive systems. While classical methods
              like DFE and MLSE remain workhorses, the future belongs to adaptive
              algorithms, learning and evolving with the channel characteristics in
              real-time. The integration of AI techniques promises steep performance
              gains, though challenges around computational complexity and
              interpretability remain. Developments advance towards 6G \cite{samsung2025ai}.
              In its context, the synergy between classical signal processing
              principles and modern machine learning approaches will become increasingly
              crucial in shaping highly capable and robust wireless communication systems.
