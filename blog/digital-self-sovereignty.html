              Digital privacy is a perpetual tension between security and usability. Moreover, responding to the question of
              data ownership has practically evolved into a necessity. To address this need, digital privacy should not be
              viewed as a binary state but rather as a continuum of choices and probabilistic safeguards. Implemented measures
              should incrementally reduce several attack vectors while necessarily remaining aligned with one's usability requirements.<br />
              I will deconstruct online privacy into its components and offer implementable solutions to users seeking
              to establish meaningful data sovereignty in an increasingly activity-tracking and surveillance-oriented digital ecosystem.
              If you haven't read <a class="highlight" href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/" target="_blank">Andrej Karpathy's blog post on digital hygiene</a>,
              I recommend you do so. This post evolved around my two cents on the topic.
            </p>
            <h3>Practical Measures</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              We should adopt a multifaceted approach for addressing both security concerns and usability requirements.
              Below, we will go into actionable details on data minimization, encryption, anonymization, and consent management.
            </p>
            <h4>Password Architecture</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Meaningful authentication mechanisms make for the primary boundary between public and protected data. Contemporary authentication systems
              predominantly rely on password verification as the initial authentication factor despite well-documented conceptual
              vulnerabilities. Knowing a password means gaining access. Therefore, a password than can easily be guessed doesn't provide any security.
              The wide-spread application of password-based authentication necessitates strategic and unique password formulation and strictly
              confidential management.<br />
              <br />
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> offers
              a compelling solution by storing passwords entirely offline in an encrypted database file.
              By you retaining ownership of the password storage, this approach avoids a fundamental
              vulnerability of cloud-based password managers: centralized third-party storage inevitably
              creates distinct, focused attack vectors, regardless of encryption strength or security promises.
              For instance, users may become more vulnerable to targeted phishing attempts.
              Encryption loses its value when you over-rely on third parties to manage your credentials while
              not really knowing what they are on about.<br />
              <br />
              Avoiding cloud-based password managers sounds compelling, but it requires weighing in usability.
              What if a user needs to sync passwords across several devices?
              In that case, a layered approach may provide a good security-convenience equilibrium: creating a password database with
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> that is then selectively synchronized via
              privacy-respecting peer-to-peer services like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a>
              retains user ownership while accommodating practical requirements.<br />
              <br />
              Increasingly, passwords are only used as an initial authentication factor. If available, multi-factor authentication (2FA)
              should universally be enabled. With 2FA, a user becomes required to provide two distinct pieces of authenticating information to get authorized.
              Note that the security benefit of 2FA increases with further physical separation
              between the two factors. A good choice would be a strong password and TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) codes for 2FA.
              The latter should be managed through dedicated, seperate applications, such as the Android app
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.beemdevelopment.aegis/">Aegis</a>,
              rather than being integrated within password managers along with the passwords.<br />
              <br />
              Different from TOTP as such, hardware-based authentication devices such as
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKeys</a> provide superior security through physical factor
              isolation. TOTP may even be loaded onto a <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>, making
              it the single physical source for your 2FA TOTP codes. Note however that multiple <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKeys</a>
              should be purchased for distributed backup and their price may preclude adoption.<br />
              <br />
              Biometric authentication sounds like a good idea, but it should be approached with caution.
              While it feels secure, unlike passwords, biometric identifiers cannot be revoked or updated following a compromise,
              allowing for a persistent vulnerability. Secure your phone ideally with multiple factors, e.g., with biometric facial recognition
              and a regularly updated alphanumeric passcode. Use KeePassXC to generate strong passcodes, or check password strength with
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/">Bitwarden's testing tool</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Operating System Architecture & Storage Encryption</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Operating system selection significantly impacts privacy posture. Linux distributions (Arch, Debian, CentOS, Linux Mint, etc.) provide
              transparency through a rigorously open-source architecture and distinctly user-controlled system maintenance. Proprietary systems such
              as Windows and macOS incorporate increasingly aggressive data collection mechanisms. Microsoft's Recall and Copilot
              functionalities exemplify this trend, requiring manual deactivation and privilege restriction to maintain data sovereignty. You can
              somewhat fight back with tools like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10">O&O ShutUp10++</a>.
              With MacOS, while some data collection can be disabled through the Privacy & Security menu, it is much more challenging to completely block
              all data sent to Apple's servers.<br />
              <br />
              Full disk encryption is a fundamental privacy requirement to be implemented across all your devices. For optimal security, encryption
              implementation should be independent from operating system manufacturers when using closed-source systems. 
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://veracrypt.eu/en/">VeraCrypt</a> provides an independent solution for Windows
              environments, while the
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://linuxconfig.org/basic-guide-to-encrypting-linux-partitions-with-luks">Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)</a>
              offers native encryption for Linux distributions. Unfortunately there is no widely available alternative to Apple's FileVault for encrypting the boot partition in MacOS.
            </p>
            <h4>Web & Network Protection</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Browser selection is critical. Chromium-based browsers face substantial privacy degradation with the 
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/manifest-v2-phase-out-begins.html">deprecation of the Manifest V2
                  protocol</a> scheduled for 2024/2025.
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> is a Firefox derivative intended for privacy-focused
              configurations while not being affected by
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://ghostbrowser.com/blog/firefoxs-terms-of-use-privacy-controversy/">Mozilla's problematic terms of use</a>.
              Search engine alternatives include <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a> and
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://metasearx.com/">Searx</a>, which do no track you.
              If you prefer to stay within the realm of Chromium-based browsers, <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/">Ungoogled Chromium</a> with the <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/chromium-web-store.mirror/"></a>Chromium Webstore</a> plugin is a good choice.
              Another open-source Chromium-based alternative is the <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a>,
              which, when set to <code>aggressive</code>, thoroughly blocks trackers and spoofs the browser's fingerprint. Truth be told though, best privacy is achieved by ditching Chromium-based browsers.<br />
              <br />
              Network-level content blocking provides superior protection compared to browser-based solutions. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) services such as
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://rethinkdns.com/">RethinkDNS</a> or <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a>
              encrypt DNS queries to prevent ISP snooping while providing customizable content filtering across all devices connected to it.<br />
              <br />
              Browser-level protections should be thought of as a necessary but secondary layer. For <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>,
              extensions such as <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a>
              from the Electronic Frontier Foundation provide solid tracker blocking capabilities. For more protection, script execution control through
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> (Firefox-based browsers) or
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf?pli=1">uMatrix</a>
              (Chromium-based browsers) enables granular connection management that yields substantial security benefits over time, albeit with some configuration overhead.
              If you don't opt for network-level content blocking, use at least either of the two script execution control extensions and 
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Communication & Productivity</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Email is an outdated but established concept. It is inherently insecure by default. Email communication benefits from client-side
              encryption through applications like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a>,
              which incorporates PGP support. I recommend Thunderbird because, generally, everything you can do outside of a web browser should
              be done outside of a web browser, as web browsers are the most attacked software.<br />
              Email service selection should consider jurisdictional specifics, with preference for providers operating under GDPR, Swiss or
              Icelandic privacy frameworks (for now).<br />
              Use your email only for communication. When registering for services, use email aliases instead of your actual email.
              This way, you can easily revoke access to a specific email alias if a service gets compromised at any point.
              A popular choice for email aliases is <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://addy.io/">Addy</a>, which offers a free tier.
              Some email providers like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton</a> offer email aliases as well.
              If you don't want to use aliases, you can still use services like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://10minutemail.com/">10minutemail</a>.<br />
              <br />
              Document processing should utilize open-source solutions like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/">OnlyOffice</a> 
              or <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, which avoid data collection and provide
              increasing compatibility with proprietary document formats.<br />
              <br />
              For messaging, <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://signal.org/#signal">Signal</a>, 
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://element.io/">Element</a>, or
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://getsession.org/">Session</a> implement end-to-end encryption
              with minimized metadata collection. <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://signal.org/#signal">Signal</a> goes
              as far as to implement post-quantum secure encryption. Activate self-destructing messages. Services such as Telegram,
              WhatsApp, Discord, and Meta's platforms should be avoided.<br />
              <br />
              Social media engagement and exposure should be minimized and depersonalized. When necessary, content consumption without authenticating prevents
              increased cross-platform tracking. Authentication via social media credentials for third-party services creates extensive tracking vectors
              and should be categorically avoided.
            </p>
            <h4>Cloud Services & Network Routing</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              General purpose cloud storage selection should prioritize services with robust privacy frameworks (GDPR, Swiss/Icelandic laws, for now) and
              additional <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://pcg.io/insights/understanding-iso-27001/">ISO 27001 certification</a>.
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/drive">Proton</a> and
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://u.pcloud.com/">pCloud</a> offer services meeting these criteria.
              If possible, one should resort to peer-to-peer solutions like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a>
              to exclusively transfer data directly between your devices.<br />
              <br />
              Do not think of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as safety or security measures.
              VPNs are privacy tools with their own drawbacks. They require careful evaluation, as the route all network traffic
              through their own infrastructure for the purpose of masking the user's IP address. A VPN is a man-in-the-middle that you have to trust,
              yet several large VPN providers are quite intransparent about their data handling, security audits and logging practices.<br />
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://mullvad.net/en">Mullvad</a> has
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://lowendbox.com/blog/the-mullvad-vpn-raid/">demonstrated</a> consistent and
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2024/12/11/the-report-for-the-2024-security-audit-of-the-app-is-now-available">thorough</a>
              privacy practices. <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://obscura.net/">Obscura</a> is a fairly new VPN provider, also with a strong focus on privacy,
              offering a two-party relay architecture in conjunction with Mullvad. Traffic is received by Obscura, but sent out to the internet by Mullvad for an added layer of obfuscation.<br />
            </p>
            <h4>Mobile Platform Hardening (Android)</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Android's architecture requires and permits users to actually apply privacy enhancements themselves. I will split this into three parts:
              First, we will look at how to make the best out of your current Android. Then, we will turn this up a notch and see what advanced users
              may want to do to further tweak their existing Android systems. Finally, we'll look at the best hollistic solution to Android system privacy,
              hardware- and software-wise.<br />
              For immediate application, one should carefully configure the Android privacy settings. Removing the
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.safetycore&hl=en-US">Android System SafetyCore app</a>
              and replacing the default GBoard keyboard with privacy-respecting alternatives like the
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.futo.inputmethod.latin.playstore&hl=en-US">FUTO Keyboard</a>
              reduces some easily avoidable data collection and tracking vectors. More generally, Android users should consider open-source app alternatives from
              sources like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>.
              Need a QR code scanner? Search on F-Droid first, you will most likely find a good alternative there that isn't data hungry by design.
              For browsing, privacy-preserving options like the Firefox-based <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/">Fennec</a>
              or the Chromium-based <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&hl=en-US">Brave Browser</a> should be considered.<br />
              <br />
              Advanced users may want to setup <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api&hl=en-US">Shizuku</a>
              and <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.samo_lego.canta/">Canta</a> for deeper system modification,
              enabling removal of proprietary system applications even on non-rooted devices. This approach requires careful research to prevent system instability.<br />
              <br />
              Note that if you have the choice, Google Pixel phones are well suited for installing
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, a privacy-focused Android fork.
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> achieves enhanced privacy by stripping
              away Google service integrations while providing extensive control over individual apps, their permissions, network access,
              and background activities overall. Additionally, a hardened memory management offers protection against potential app
              vulnerabilities. GrapheneOS, while not that trivial to install, provides a significantly more secure experience than
              stock Android or iOS.
            </p>
            <h4>Artificial Intelligence & Large Language Models</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              AI interaction brings entirely new privacy challenges. Locality and data ownership represent optimal paradigms for interaction
              with Large Language Models (LLMs), with tools like <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>
              enabling local LLM operation.<br />
              <br />
              When utilizing web-based or cloud-based LLMs, all providers should be treated with caution.
              I would go so far as to say that all non-local LLM interfaces should be treated as potential keystroke loggers.
              Directly or indirectly personally identifiable information, confidential data, and sensitive or just related content should
              never <i>ever</i> be shared with non-local LLMs.

            <h3>The Connected Identity</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Privacy discourse often focuses on data access prevention. This neglects the increasing identity contextualization.
              Modern tracking extends beyond traditional cookies and usage statistics to behavioral fingerprinting that creates
              persistent cross-platform identifiers.
              As shown in a <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ProtonPrivacy/status/1902784700155936887">post from Proton</a>,
              these techniques are viewed as a USP for data brokers, enabling comprehensive profile construction for even more targeted ads regardless
              of classic privacy measures.<br />
              <br />
              While certain tools claim to help by finding and deleting your data from data brokers, they are not solving the problem at all.
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/browser-anti-fingerprinting-techniques/">Research</a> suggests that
              many anti-fingerprinting techniques may not be as effective as claimed and can sometimes make users even more identifiable due to
              the inconsistencies said measures may introduce. You stand out by trying to hide. Still, some measures can be applied.<br />
              For Firefox-based browsers, you can follow the concept of uniformity: Make your browser look distinctly like everybody else's.
              This is achieved by enabling the <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> flag in <code>about:config</code>, which <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>
              has enabled by default.<br />
              Given the concept of uniformity, you can add to that the idea of randomness within bounds that suggest normality. You may want to install
              the <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/">User-Agent Switcher and Manager</a>
              and have your browser pretend to be Google Chrome on a Windows PC, the most commonly used setup. You should also setup
              <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/">CanvasBlocker</a> to
              actively prevent websites from using certain Javascript APIs for fingerprinting.

            <h3>GDPR: Tech Bro's Nightmare</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most comprehensive privacy legislation framework implemented globally.
              Despite criticism from technology executives, particularly those with business models dependent on aspects of what is refered to as
              'surveillance capitalism', GDPR fundamentally shifts power dynamics between users and technology providers by establishing expensive-to-break
              data ownership principles.<br />
              <br />
              GDPR's core provisions contain explicit consent requirements, data minimization, purpose limitation, accountability mechanisms, and the
              right to complete and total erasure. These requirements are legally binding with substantial penalties reaching 4% of global annual revenue or
              â‚¬20 million, exemplified by <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/01/04/meta-fined-390m-for-privacy-law-breaches-in-the-eu">Meta's â‚¬390 million fine issued in January 2023</a>.<br />
              A company operating in the EU from anywhere in the world has to adhere to the GDPR when it comes to processing the data of EU citizens.<br />
              <br />
              When users can demand transparency regarding data collection and algorithmic decision-making, business models predicated on opaque data
              extraction become unsustainable.
              Opposition to GDPR reveals the uncomfortable reality that many "innovative" business models fundamentally depend on privacy asymmetries rather
              than foremost genuine user-centered value creation. Companies claiming that innovation requires unrestricted data access are acknowledging
              their inability to obtain informed consent for their practices.<br />
              Claims that GDPR inhibits innovation are creating popularity for said opposition. This inverts reality. European companies effectively enjoy 
              competitive advantages in global markets. Companies including Mullvad and Proton have developed successful business models with GDPR
              compliance as a differentiating feature of quality and an indicator for trustworthiness when it comes to privacy.

            <h3>Conclusion: Probabilistic Protection</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              Comprehensive privacy requires a hollistic and systematic approach, spanning not just encryption, geographic distribution, and regular updates.
              Privacy fundamentally represents a probabilistic challenge rather than a binary state - each implemented protection layer compounds security
              benefits while reducing the probability for compromise.<br />
              <br />
              The privacy framework presented here balances theoretical ideals with practical implementation constraints. While some usability friction is
              unavoidable, security benefits can substantially outweigh convenience costs.<br />
              The objective is not a paranoid isolation but awareness and data sovereignty. Users should maintain awareness of data flows and developments in law
              and act accordingly, implementing reasonable protective measures, and exercising conscious decision-making regarding digital engagement.
              Privacy represents not merely a technical challenge but a fundamental component of digital agency.
