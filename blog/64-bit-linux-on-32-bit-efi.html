          <div class="blog-entry">
            <p class="blog-p">
              It seems that a restrictive systems design approach is gaining more traction in the end-user compute market, intentionally
              locking users into a preset operating system configuration. This enables manufacturers to exercise more control over the system, 
              which on the one hand can increase security, but on the other hand may also allow for software-induced
              planned obsolescence. For instance, the Windows 11 requirements for TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot effectively excluded older
              hardware from running the latest Windows version. Support for Windows 10 is scheduled to cease by 2025. However, some cases are more
              subtle, requiring a closer look.<br />
              <br />
              The ASUS X205TA exemplifies such a case. While it features 64-bit-capable hardware, its chipset defaults to 32-bit EFI firmware.
              The system ships with safe-boot-protected 32-bit Windows 8.1 pre-installed - a design choice that imposes artificial software
              restrictions, limiting the system's potential despite its 64-bit hardware architecture.<br />
              One key restriction from this choice is the inability to run modern operating systems, which are increasingly exclusive to 64-bit environments.
              This trend is intriguing and motivates my goal: Find a way to install Ubuntu by circumventing the imposed 32-bit
              constraints to provide a fully functional 64-bit Linux environment.
            </p>
            <h4>What is EFI?</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) is the more modern replacement for the legacy BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).
              It serves as the core interface between a computer's chipset firmware and the installed operating system, acting
              essentially as a mediator between the two to provide the booting operating system with control over the hardware resources needed for operation.<br />
              <br />
              EFI is designed to address limitations of BIOS, offering for example:<br />
              <br />
              $\rightarrow$ Faster boot times, <br />
              $\rightarrow$ Improved security features, and <br />
              $\rightarrow$ Support for larger storage devices. <br />
              <br />
              The ASUS X205TA comes with 32-bit EFI. It uses 32-bit addressing, limiting compatibility with 64-bit bootloaders.
              Systems with 64-bit CPUs but 32-bit EFI firmware, like the ASUS X205TA, cannot natively boot 64-bit operating systems, 
              as they expect a compatible 64-bit EFI or BIOS environment. In other words, we need a workaround.
            </p>
            <h4>What is GRUB?</h4>
            <p class="blog-p">
              GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a bootloader typically used by Linux systems, enabling the kick-off for the boot routines
              of an installed operating system. GRUB can present a menu to choose between installed operating systems. If configured properly,
              GRUB can then load the Linux kernel into memory and pass control to it, starting the operating system.
              GRUB must be installed in a way that integrates with the EFI's boot process. If we encounter a mismatch between
              the EFI architecture and GRUB configurations, we will encounter boot errors, making GRUB and any installed operating system unusable.
            </p>
            <h3>Preparation Phase</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              $\textbf{1)}$ I chose to install Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS for the X205TA. At the time of writing this (2024), 22.04 LTS was
              quite battle-proven and still supported with updates. I downloaded the regular amd64 iso file.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{2)}$ (Skip this if you only have systems running Windows available at this point) I only had the X205TA itself,
              so I had to make all pre-configurations from within Windows. However, if you are lucky and have a separate system running
              Linux, you may modify the iso file there before creating the bootable USB stick by treating the iso with the
              <code>treetoobitiso.sh</code> from <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://linuxiumcomau.blogspot.com/2022/05/adding-32-bit-grub-bootloader-to-boot.html">linuxium.com.au</a>.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{3)}$ I thoroughly recommend creating the bootable USB for Linux with the Windows-only tool Rufus, because Rufus
              allows for explicitly setting the partition scheme and the boot mode for the bootable USB. I turned the Ubuntu iso file
              into a bootable USB with these Rufus settings:<br />
              <br />
              $\rightarrow$ <code>GPT</code> partition scheme <br />
              $\rightarrow$ <code>UEFI (non-CSM)</code> boot mode <br />
              $\rightarrow$ <code>FAT32</code> file system <br />
              $\rightarrow$ Everything else left to default<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{4)}$ (Skip this if you performed step $2$) The install process requires the presence of a file
              called <code>bootia32.efi</code>. This file enables the Ubuntu installer to run in 32-bit EFI mode. Download the 
              <code>bootia32.efi</code> file from <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nguyentumine/AIO-Boot/blob/master/EFI/BOOT/bootia32.efi">github.com/nguyentumine/AIO-Boot</a>
              and paste it into <code>/EFI/boot</code> on your bootable USB.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{5)}$ Disconnect the USB from your computer and shut down the X205TA. While shut off, place the X205TA in front of
              you and plug the USB into the USB port closest to you on the right side. Using specifically this port will allow for the
              USB to become a boot option in EFI later.
            </p>
            <h3>Setting EFI and Booting into the Live System</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              From here on out, embrace complexity:<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{6)}$ Boot the X205TA while hitting <code>F2</code> repeatedly to show the EFI menu. Within EFI, <code>disable</code> the Safe Boot option.
              Save this change without exiting and select the USB drive as your Boot override option.
              The Ubuntu installer should start up.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{7)}$ When prompted, do not go for a direct installation, but start the live system. From within there, run the full installation process.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{8)}$ Anticipate GRUB installation errors popping up. They will occur right at the end of the installation, because
              the GRUB packages contained within the installation medium address only 64-bit-EFI, 64-bit-BIOS or 32-bit-BIOS systems.
              What we need is support for our 32-bit-EFI.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{9)}$ <b>Do not restart</b> after the installation completes. Instead, opt for staying in the live system.
            </p>
            <h3>Adapting GRUB</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              GRUB's initial installation will fail due to incompatibilities. However, we can fix this first attempt through
              some reconfiguration:<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{10)}$ Connect the live system to the internet, if not done already. There, download the <code>grubia32.efi</code>
              from <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nguyentumine/AIO-Boot/blob/master/EFI/BOOT/grubia32.efi">github.com/nguyentumine/AIO-Boot</a>.
              Then, open a terminal and type this:</p>
<pre><code># Navigate to where the grubia32.efi was downloaded to
cd ~/Downloads<br />
                
# Mount system partitions
# Find your system partitions by running `lsblk`, look for those marked `boot` and `root`
# This is the root partition
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk2p2 /mnt
# This is the boot partition
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk2p1 /mnt/boot/efi
                
# Bind critical system directories
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run
                
# Replace 64-bit GRUB with 32-bit equivalent
sudo cp grubia32.efi /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi</code></pre>
            <p class="blog-p">
              This sequence essentially hot-wires GRUB to pretend to Ubuntu that it is 64-bit while actually being compatible with
              the 32-bit boot setting. Note that we didn't install GRUB yet, we just overrode a file.<br />
              <br />
              $\textbf{11)}$ To now go on and install this hot-wired GRUB, type this into the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chroot /mnt
update-grub
update-grub2
</code></pre>
            <p class="blog-p">
              $\textbf{12)}$ Step 11's commands will still throw warnings, but they will create the files necessary for
              booting into GRUB. Still within the terminal, type this:
            </p>
<pre><code>exit
sudo umount /mnt/dev /mnt/proc /mnt/sys /mnt/boot/efi /mnt
sudo reboot
</code></pre>
            <p class="blog-p">
              $\textbf{13)}$ The X205TA will now boot into a GRUB command line interface. Once you're there, type this:
            </p>
<pre><code>set root=(hd0,gpt2) 
configfile /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre>
            <p class="blog-p">
              At this point, we made the 32-bit EFI interact with GRUB successfully, but GRUB doesn't yet itself know exactly
              how to boot our installed Ubuntu. However, with these GRUB commands, we can hot-wire that too. Your Ubuntu will
              now boot (initial boot, it takes some time). The problem is that you would have to type the GRUB commands everytime
              you boot. Let's fix that.
            </p>
            <h3>Adapting GRUB, Reloaded</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              $\textbf{14)}$ Connect to the internet. Then, run this:<br />
<pre><code>sudo apt update

sudo apt-get purge --allow-remove-essential shim-signed grub-efi-amd64-signed
sudo apt-get install --allow-remove-essential grub-efi-ia32 grub-efi-ia32-bin

sudo mount /dev/mmcblk2p2 /mnt
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk2p1 /mnt/boot/efi

sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys

sudo chroot /mnt

grub-install --target=i386-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
exit

sudo umount /mnt/dev /mnt/proc /mnt/run /mnt/sys /mnt/boot/efi /mnt
sudo reboot
</code></pre>
            <p class="blog-p">
              This overrides the makeshift GRUB setup we used to get the system running and now fully supplies the correct GRUB with
              the correct system paths for booting. The system should reboot without requiring the GRUB commands anymore.<br />
              <br />
              A quick note on the <code>chroot</code> command: The <code>chroot</code> (change root) command temporarily changes
              the root directory for the current running terminal. This creates an isolated environment where the system behaves
              as if the specified directory we build by mounting specific partitions in specific locations is the root of the filesystem.
              We essentially play a game of pretend with the GRUB installer.<br />
              <br />
              As we ran a very modified installation of Ubuntu, you might encounter residual items from the installing process within the
              installed system, like the live system's icon offering you to <code>"Install RELEASE"</code>. Don't click it, but instead
              remove it via <code>sudo apt-get remove ubiquity</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="blog-p">
              The ASUS X205TA now runs 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS behind a 32-bit EFI. Note that procedures for updates and even distribution upgrades can be applied just as usual. I managed to upgrade to 24.04.1 LTS which brought further noticable improvements in system performance.<br /> 
              What began as a constrained hardware environment became a playground for systemic understanding.
              Ubuntu now runs, not by design, but through our intervention. This grants an older,
              but capable system like the X205TA a new and extended life.
            </p>
